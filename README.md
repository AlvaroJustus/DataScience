# **Wine Quality Analysis**

## **Abstract**
This work aims to perform an exploratory analysis in a database on the quality of red wines. The database consists 
of wine samples from the north of Portugal, provided by the Viticulture Commission of the Vinho Verde Region (CVRVV). 
The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests (see [Cortez et al., 2009](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/)) using machine learning techniques and models to classify and predict dataset data. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

## Data Information ##

|**Number of Instances:**| 4898      | **Attribute Characteristics:** |  Real    |
|------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|----------|
|    **Date Donated:**   | 2009-10-07|          **Area:**             | Business |

* There are 12 classes that make up the dataset. There is no previous information about any class, so it is necessary to analyze the influence and relevance of each one.

**Attribute Information:**

For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/). 

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

* 1 - Fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm3)
* 2 - Volatile acidity (g(acetic acid)/dm3)
* 3 - Citric acid (g/dm3)
* 4 - Residual sugar (g/dm3)
* 5 - Chlorides (g(sodium chloride)/dm3)
* 6 - Free sulfur dioxide (mg/dm3)
* 7 - Total sulfur dioxide (mg/dm3)
* 8 - Density (g/cm3)
* 9 - pH
* 10 - Sulphates (g(potassium sulphate)/dm3)
* 11 - Alcohol (% vol.)

Output variable (based on sensory data):
* 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
